# Fix Clerk Google OAuth Stuck Issue (LEGACY PATHS - MAY NOT WORK)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Clerk Dashboard Configuration

**You MUST update these settings in your Clerk Dashboard:**

### ❌ OLD PATHS (May not exist anymore):
- ~~User & Authentication → Social Connections → Google~~ 
- ~~Configure → Paths~~

### ✅ **NEW GUIDE AVAILABLE:**
**Please refer to `CLERK_CURRENT_PATHS_GUIDE.md` for current dashboard navigation**

---

## The Goal Remains the Same:

**TURN OFF:**
- ❌ "Redirect to hosted sign-in page"
- ❌ "Redirect to hosted sign-up page"  
- ❌ Any "Use hosted pages" options

**TURN ON:**
- ✅ "Enable modal mode"
- ✅ "Use modal for authentication"

**Set redirect paths to EMPTY or "/":**
- Sign-in URL: `/` (or leave empty)
- Sign-up URL: `/` (or leave empty) 
- After sign-in URL: `/`
- After sign-up URL: `/`

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

Clerk defaults to "hosted pages mode" where authentication happens on Clerk's servers. We want "modal mode" where authentication happens within your app.

## 🧪 After Making These Changes

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Test Google signup again
3. It should open a modal within your app instead of redirecting
